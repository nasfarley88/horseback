# horseback
A (very alpha) bot API that targets *every* bot API it can.

> For a large part of human history, communication happened at the speed of a horse. Sending a message and getting a reply could take days or even months. Today our messages travel thousands of miles into the sky ...

## The problem
Making bots are fun. Picking a medium that *all* of your friends/customers/potential users all use is difficult. Everyone has a favourite client which they won't leave, not matter how good your bot is. Inevitably, you pick a medium and go all in. Best case: everyone switches. Worst case: everyone leaves.

## The solution
Sometimes it feels like it would be easier to send messages on horseback ... or you can send messages via `horseback`, the one bot API to rule them all! 

Currently supported bot APIs:
